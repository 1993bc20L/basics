    <h1>How To Achieve A Good Life?</h1>
    <h3>1. Be Productive:</h3>
    <p>Your goal should be to produce something of worth and value for the world.</p>

    <h3>2. Value Relationships:</h3>
    <p>Collect and cultivate relationships with people who know you, know what you are about and like you.</p>
    <p>Those who don't contribute to society often find that they pay a price in the form of solitude.</p>

    <h3>3. Respect Your Origins:</h3>
    <p id="Bantu">Know your culture, heritage, language and history</p>

    <h3>4. Spiritual Health:</h3>
    <p>No matter what you believe, it is important to spend time focussing 
      on your spirituality and your beliefs.</p>

    <h3>5. Plant The Seeds:</h3>
    <p><strong>God</strong> says; "If you plant the seed, i will make the tree."
       He just expects you to plant the seed, he will do the rest.</p> <br>
